Description: Provides a unified implementation of several geographically weighted regression
    models, including extensions such as GWGLM, GWQR, GWOLR, GWMMR and TSGWML. The package supports
    bandwidth selection via CV or AICc, parallel computing, and diagnostic tools 
    such as Monte Carlo and bootstrap-based spatial variability tests.
