\usage{
gwmmr_simple(
  formula,
  cordxy,
  distmethod = "euclidean",
  h,
  kernel,
  adaptive = TRUE,
  data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the model structure (e.g., \code{cbind(y1, y2) ~ x1 + x2 + x3}).}

\item{cordxy}{A matrix of spatial coordinates, with columns representing X and Y.}

\item{distmethod}{A character string indicating the distance calculation method to use.
Supported options are \code{"euclidean"} (default), \code{"greatcircle"} (great-circle distance), and \code{"manhattan"} (city-block distance).}

\item{h}{The bandwidth used in the kernel function.}

\item{kernel}{A character string specifying the kernel function used to compute spatial weights.
Options are \code{"global"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"exponential"}, \code{"bisquare"}, \code{"tricube"}, and \code{"boxcar"}.}

\item{adaptive}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), uses adaptive bandwidth. If \code{FALSE}, uses fixed bandwidth.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing all variables used in the model.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{beta}: A matrix of local regression coefficients.
\item \code{pred}: A matrix of fitted values for each observation and response.
\item \code{residual}: A matrix of residuals, defined as observed minus fitted values.
\item \code{stat}: A vector of Frobenius norms calculated from the local covariance matrices of selected pairs of coefficients. Used as a summary statistic in Monte Carlo testing.
}
}
\description{
This function performs a lightweight estimation for Geographically Weighted Multivariate Multiple Regression (GWMMMR) models.
It returns local regression coefficients, fitted values, and a Frobenius-norm-based variability statistic for each coefficient,
without computing AIC, or hypothesis testing. This function is designed for internal reuse, such as in permutation
or Monte Carlo procedures.
}
\details{
This function omits computationally intensive components such as leverage matrix, AIC, and local hypothesis testing.
It is particularly useful for scenarios requiring repeated model fitting, such as resampling-based significance testing.
