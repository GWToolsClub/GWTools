\usage{
orderedfit(y, X, link = "probit", Gweights, id.fixed.vars, start.values)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{An ordered factor vector of responses.}

\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of independent variables (without intercept).}

\item{link}{The link function to use. Either \code{"probit"} (default) or \code{"logit"}.}

\item{Gweights}{A numeric vector of weights for each observation (e.g., kernel weights from spatial models).}

\item{id.fixed.vars}{Integer vector specifying which coefficients to hold fixed during optimization. Use \code{NA} to indicate no fixed coefficients.}

\item{start.values}{Initial values for the parameters to be optimized.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{LogL}{Log-likelihood at the optimum.}
\item{coefficients}{Estimated coefficients including thresholds.}
\item{std.err}{Standard errors of the coefficients.}
\item{t.value}{t-statistics of the coefficients.}
\item{Betas}{Estimated slope coefficients.}
\item{zeta}{Estimated threshold values (not the reparameterized form).}
\item{V.g}{Variance-covariance matrix for the slope coefficients.}

\description{
Estimates an ordinal regression model using a weighted likelihood approach.
This function is adapted with minor modifications from Dong, Nakaya, and Brunsdon (2020),
who proposed it as a local estimation procedure in their geographically weighted ordinal regression model.
}
\details{
This function is adapted with only minor modifications from Dong, G., Nakaya, T., & Brunsdon, C. (2020).
It retains their original formulation of the likelihood, gradient, and Hessian for efficient estimation of an ordered response model.

The following notes are quoted directly from the original authors:
\emph{
" First, write the likelihood function of a standard ordered model and its gradient and hessian for fast optimisation.
We assume there are five ordered responses as in our SWB data, but extension to data with fewer or more categories is trivial.
ALSO, we DO NOT have an intercept in the model. Then, we maximise the log-likelihood function and output estimated parameters."
