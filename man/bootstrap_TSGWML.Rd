\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the model structure (response ~ predictors).}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the distribution family. Supported options are \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"poisson"}, and \code{"binomial"}.}

\item{cordxy}{A matrix of spatial coordinates, with columns representing X and Y.}

\item{distmethod}{A character string indicating the distance calculation method to use.
Supported options are \code{"euclidean"} (default), \code{"greatcircle"} (great-circle distance), and \code{"manhattan"} (city-block distance).}

\item{h1}{Bandwidth used for the first-stage (fully local) estimation.}

\item{h2}{Bandwidth used for the second-stage (local + global) estimation.}

\item{kernel}{A character string specifying the kernel function used to compute spatial weights.
Options are \code{"global"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"exponential"}, \code{"bisquare"}, \code{"tricube"}, and \code{"boxcar"}.}

\item{adaptive}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), uses adaptive bandwidth. If \code{FALSE}, uses fixed bandwidth.}

\item{offset}{A character string giving the name of a column in the data to be used as offset (optional).
If not provided, only the internal offset from fixed coefficients is used.}

\item{local_var}{A character vector of variable names to be treated as spatially varying (local) coefficients.}

\item{global_var}{A character vector of variable names to be treated as spatially invariant (global) coefficients.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing all variables used in the model.}

\item{R}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replications. Default is 99.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), enables parallel computation. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{core}{Integer. The number of CPU cores to use when \code{parallel = TRUE}.
If \code{NULL}, the number of cores is set to the total number of detected cores minus 2.}

\value{
A list of class \code{"bootstrap_TSGWML"} with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{formula}: A formula object.
\item \code{local_var}: A character vector of spatially varying variable names.
\item \code{global_var}: A character vector of spatially invariant variable names.
\item \code{pvalue}: A numeric scalar. The bootstrap p-value from the likelihood ratio test.
\item \code{c_tvalue}: A numeric scalar. The observed LRT statistic from the original data.
\item \code{constant_se}: A named numeric vector of bootstrap standard errors for global coefficients.
\item \code{varying_se}: A data frame of bootstrap standard errors for local coefficients.
\item \code{call}: The matched function call that produced this object.
}

\description{
This function evaluates whether the spatially varying (local) coefficients in a two-stage
geographically weighted model significantly improve model fit.
It performs a parametric bootstrap-based likelihood ratio test (LRT),
by regenerating the response variable based on predicted values from the fitted model,
to assess the significance of spatially varying coefficients.
Additionally, the function estimates bootstrap-based standard errors for all coefficients.
}
\details{
In addition to standard binary response variables of numeric \code{0/1} type,
this function and the associated GWGLM series uniquely support proportion-type responses
expressed as success counts and total trials (e.g., \code{y/n}).

When success/trial matrices are provided, the function automatically computes the success proportions internally,
eliminating the need for manual preprocessing.

This feature broadens the flexibility of modeling binary and proportion data,
addressing a common limitation in existing geographically weighted modeling packages.
