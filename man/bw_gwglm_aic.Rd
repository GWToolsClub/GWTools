\usage{
bw_gwglm_aic(
  formula,
  family,
  cordxy,
  distmethod = "euclidean",

  adaptive = TRUE,
  cvar = 0,
  data,
  bw_min = NA,
  bw_max = NA,
  parallel = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the model structure (response ~ predictors).}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the distribution family. Supported options are \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"poisson"}, and \code{"binomial"}.}

\item{cordxy}{A matrix of spatial coordinates, with columns representing X and Y.}

\item{distmethod}{A character string indicating the distance calculation method to use.
Supported options are \code{"euclidean"} (default), \code{"greatcircle"} (great-circle distance), and \code{"manhattan"} (city-block distance).}

\item{kernel}{A character string specifying the kernel function used to compute spatial weights.
Options are \code{"global"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"exponential"}, \code{"bisquare"}, \code{"tricube"}, and \code{"boxcar"}.}

\item{adaptive}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), uses adaptive bandwidth. If \code{FALSE}, uses fixed bandwidth.}

\item{cvar}{A numeric value. An optional adjustment to the effective number of parameters, commonly used when some variables are modeled with fixed (non-spatially varying) coefficients.
The default is \code{0}.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing all variables used in the model.}

\item{bw_min}{Minimum bandwidth value for the AICc-based search.
If \code{NA} (default), it is automatically set to the 10th percentile of non-zero distances (for fixed bandwidth) or 10\% of the number of observations (for adaptive bandwidth).}

\item{bw_max}{Maximum bandwidth value for the AICc-based search.
If \code{NA} (default), it is automatically set to the 90th percentile of non-zero distances (for fixed bandwidth) or 90\% of the number of observations (for adaptive bandwidth).}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), enables parallel computation during the AICc procedure to improve speed.}

\item{core}{Integer. The number of CPU cores to use when \code{parallel = TRUE}.
If \code{NULL}, the number of cores is set to the total number of detected cores minus 2.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the optimal bandwidth.
}
\description{
This function selects the optimal bandwidth for a Geographically Weighted Generalized Linear Model (GWGLM)
by minimizing the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) using a golden section search algorithm.
It supports Gaussian, Poisson, and Binomial families, and offers both fixed and adaptive bandwidth options.
Parallel computing is supported to accelerate the AICc evaluation process.
}
\details{
In addition to standard binary response variables of numeric \code{0/1} type,
this function and the associated GWGLM series uniquely support proportion-type responses
expressed as success counts and total trials (e.g., \code{y/n}).

When success/trial matrices are provided, the function automatically computes the success proportions internally,
eliminating the need for manual preprocessing.

This feature broadens the flexibility of modeling binary and proportion data,
addressing a common limitation in existing geographically weighted modeling packages.
